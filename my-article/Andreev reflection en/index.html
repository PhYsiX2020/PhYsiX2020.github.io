<blockquote>
<p>At the metal-superconductor interface, when an electron is reflected
back from the normal metal, it generates a hole while forming a Cooper
pair in the superconductor. This means that when electrons in the
superconductor undergo reflection or scattering at the interface, the
superconductor still retains its pairing mechanism. Does this imply that
low-energy electrons become part of many Cooper pairs in the
superconductor? What about electrons with energies higher than the
gap?</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>The state of the incident electron is matched to the condensed state
of the superconductor. This matching is achieved through the boundary
conditions of momentum, energy, and phase continuity. When a hole is
reflected, it "returns" part of the current to the normal metal, while
the net current enters the superconductor through the formation of
Cooper pairs.</p>
<p>Electrons with energy higher than the superconducting gap can
directly enter the superconductor, but they do not form Cooper pairs;
instead, they propagate as renormalized quasiparticles, existing as
discrete energy states above the gap. Such quasiparticles are
superpositions of electrons and holes, with their energy resulting from
a combined contribution of kinetic energy and pairing potential.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>For this electron, it becomes "superconducting." How does its nature
change?</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>In normal metals, electrons are independent moving particles whose
behavior is primarily governed by the Fermi-Dirac distribution and is
influenced by scattering from the lattice or impurities. Once these
electrons become Cooper pairs in the superconductor, they are no longer
independent but are tightly correlated with another electron of opposite
momentum and spin. Together, they form a quantum condensed state,
manifesting as a macroscopic quantum phenomenon.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Why are such quasiparticles superpositions of electrons and holes?
High-energy electrons entering the superconductor form
quasiparticles—why do they create such superpositions? In contrast,
low-energy electrons entering the superconductor form Cooper pairs,
which are not electron-hole superpositions but rather a two-electron
state.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>In a superconductor, individual electron and hole states are no
longer independent free states. Instead, they couple through the pairing
mechanism within the superconducting energy gap, forming a new
excitation state: the quasiparticle. The momentum of these
quasiparticles is constrained by the boundary conditions of the
superconducting condensate, but they still retain quasi-free propagation
properties. This quasi-freedom arises because quasiparticles are not
entirely decoupled from the coherent wavefunction of Cooper pairs but
are superimposed upon it. Electrons and holes are no longer isolated
particles; they are coupled via the superconducting gap. Quasiparticles
are superpositions of electrons and holes, leading to fractional charge
properties, and their energy states describe the rearrangement of
electrons and holes in the superconductor.</p>

\gamma^\dagger_{k} = u_k c^\dagger_k - v_k c_{-k},

with momentum <span class="math inline">\(-k\)</span> (i.e., the
creation of a hole with momentum <span
class="math inline">\(-k\)</span>). This superposition state reflects
the non-classical behavior of single electrons (or holes) in the
superconducting condensate.</p>
<p>Cooper pairs are bound states of two electrons with opposite momentum
and energy lower than the superconducting gap. This <strong>two-electron
state</strong> is a stable pairing structure, independent of single
electron or single hole states:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Psi_{\text{Cooper Pair}} = c^\dagger_{k\uparrow}
c^\dagger_{-k\downarrow}.
\]</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The superconducting pairing mechanism seems fascinating to me, as if
it tightly connects two electrons moving in opposite directions and
allows them to propagate in an even higher-order mechanism. The time
scale of lattice deformation induces a local cloud of positive charge,
creating an indirect electron-electron attraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>Phonon frequencies are typically in the range of <span
class="math inline">\(10^{12}-10^{13}\)</span> Hz, corresponding to a
time scale of <span class="math inline">\(0.1–1\)</span> picoseconds.
Within this recovery time, the interaction between two electrons is
governed by quantum mechanics rather than being entirely overwhelmed by
classical Coulomb repulsion. Due to the uncertainty principle, this
short time scale allows the electrons to interact with the lattice,
forming transient bound states whose stability is determined by the
superconducting gap <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. As long
as the attraction between electrons overcomes energy fluctuations caused
by thermal disturbance or other scattering, the bound state can persist.
The balance between phonon lifetime (lag time) and electron velocity is
a critical foundation of the Cooper pair theory.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>However, pairing and superposition alone do not directly lead to the
conclusion of a macroscopic wavefunction or dissipationless
transport.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>Your skepticism is very precise! Indeed, merely describing "pairing"
and "superposition" does not directly lead to conclusions about the
macroscopic wavefunction or dissipationless transport in
superconductors. These phenomena need to be derived from higher-level
theories. The pairing mechanism of Cooper pairs provides a starting
point, but the core of superconductivity lies in the macroscopic
condensation of all Cooper pairs.</p>
<p>Since electrons are identical particles, a large number of Cooper
pairs can condense into a single macroscopic quantum state, forming an
overall coherent wavefunction. In a superconductor, all Cooper pairs can
be described by one <strong>macroscopic wavefunction</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Psi_{\text{macro}} = \prod_k \left(u_k + v_k c^\dagger_{k\uparrow}
c^\dagger_{-k\downarrow}\right).
\]</span></p>
<p>The phase of this wavefunction remains consistent across the entire
superconductor. This phase coherence leads to many macroscopic
phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Josephson effect:</strong> The tunneling current between
superconductors is directly related to the phase difference.</li>
<li><strong>Magnetic flux quantization:</strong> The magnetic flux in a
superconductor is confined to quantized units (<span
class="math inline">\(\Phi_0 = h/2e\)</span>), a direct consequence of
phase coherence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the overall coherence of the wavefunction, defects or
impurities in the lattice cannot disrupt the motion of Cooper pairs
(unless the energy exceeds <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>,
sufficient to break the Cooper pairs themselves), leading to
dissipationless transport.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I still don’t understand why this mechanism and propagation are
dissipationless. So far, our discussion has not pinpointed what exactly
makes it dissipationless. While we mentioned the coherence and wholeness
of the wavefunction, we still haven’t specifically clarified why it is
coherent and unbreakable.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>An excellent question! To address why the superconducting mechanism
leads to dissipationless transport and why Cooper pair propagation is
not scattered or disrupted by impurities, we must delve deeper. This
cannot simply be attributed to "coherence" alone; we need to explain why
scattering fails and the deeper physical mechanism of coherence.</p>
<p>The coherence of the overall wavefunction originates from the
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the superconductor (related to <span
class="math inline">\(U(1)\)</span> symmetry). The formation of the
superconducting state lowers the free energy of the system, representing
a spontaneous symmetry-breaking process. From a thermodynamic
perspective, the superconducting condensate is a more stable state than
the normal state. This stability arises from the collective behavior of
the Cooper pairs in the system, rather than from the contributions of
individual electrons or phonons.</p>
<p>In a normal metal, electrons are single particles, and their motion
can be disrupted by local interactions, leading to scattering. In the
superconducting condensate, the scattering effect on an individual
Cooper pair is immediately absorbed by other Cooper pairs, preserving
the overall coherence of the wavefunction. The phase of the
superconducting wavefunction is a representation of a global quantum
state, with extremely high "phase rigidity." If a local Cooper pair is
perturbed (e.g., by scattering), the entire wavefunction adjusts its
phase to compensate for the disturbance.</p>
<p>If coherence were broken, neither dissipationless transport nor the
Meissner effect would exist. The phase rigidity ensures that the
superconducting wavefunction cannot be easily disrupted, maintaining
dissipationless current.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>This point also puzzles me. The superconducting gap is a forbidden
region for transmission. Why can it couple electrons and holes? Are the
energies of electrons and holes, respectively, above and below the
gap?</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>You’ve raised a very interesting and profound question! Indeed, the
superconducting gap (<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>) is a
unique energy range that delineates the boundary between the
superconducting state and the excited states. So, the key issue is: how
can electrons and holes couple within this gap? Why can their energy
ranges be related?</p>
<p>The coupling of electrons and holes arises because, in the
superconductor, quasiparticle states are no longer pure electrons or
holes but rather superpositions of both. While the superconducting gap
constrains single-particle energy within a specific range (above <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>), the superposition of electron
and hole states still shares a common condensate wavefunction, allowing
their momentum and energy to couple through the pairing potential (<span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>).</p>
<p>In a superconductor, the coupling of electrons and holes is not a
straightforward image of “one electron above the gap and one hole below
the gap.” Instead, the energy distribution of electrons and holes is
jointly determined by the form of quasiparticle excitation. Near <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, single electron and hole quantum
states are no longer independent but form a mixed quasiparticle state (a
superposition of electron and hole states). When electrons and holes
couple, the system forms a lower-energy, more stable quasiparticle state
through wavefunction mixing.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Has renormalization already occurred? How does it happen? It seems to
be some kind of mathematical technique, but I still don’t understand how
it manifests in our process.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>A great question! Renormalization is not just a "mathematical
technique" but also reflects how a physical system deals with complex
interactions. In the context of superconductors, renormalization
involves the formation of quasiparticles (superpositions of
electron-hole states). Renormalization is a mathematical method used to
handle the complexity of interactions in physical systems. For example,
in interacting systems, the free state of a single particle is no longer
a simple “bare particle” but becomes a “dressed particle” modified by
interactions with its environment. Through renormalization, we introduce
the concept of a “quasiparticle,” which is an effective description of a
particle after interacting with its surroundings.</p>
<p>In superconductors, the superconducting pairing potential causes
electrons and holes to couple. This means that the independent electron
and hole states are no longer stable; they mix into a new superposition
state. This renormalization process modifies the energy, momentum, and
mass of the particles, leading to the formation of stable, effective
excitation states.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been misunderstanding this the whole time. I always thought that
electrons with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(-k\)</span> were paired, but is it true that an
electron with <span class="math inline">\(-k\)</span> is actually a
hole?</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>This is a very critical point you’ve touched upon! In the context of
<strong>momentum-space matching</strong>, it is indeed easy to cause
some misunderstanding. Let’s clarify this issue and explain why this
perspective is crucial for understanding superconducting theory.</p>
<p>A hole with momentum <span class="math inline">\(-k\)</span> can be
understood as the <strong>absence</strong> of an electron with momentum
<span class="math inline">\(-k\)</span>. This conversion of description
is achieved through the <strong>concept of holes</strong>. Near the
Fermi surface, an electron with momentum <span
class="math inline">\(-k\)</span> is equivalent to the <strong>dual
state</strong> of an electron with momentum <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>On the Fermi surface, the excitation states of electrons and holes
are symmetric. An electron with momentum <span
class="math inline">\(-k\)</span> can be viewed as a “hole”: if an
electron with momentum <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> disappears
from the Fermi surface, this is described as the appearance of a hole at
momentum <span class="math inline">\(-k\)</span>.</p>
<p>In momentum space, the wavefunctions of electrons and holes are
mutually dual. This duality is reflected in the symmetry of the Fermi
surface. Thus, in a superconducting system, the pairing mechanism
between an electron with momentum <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>
and an electron with momentum <span class="math inline">\(-k\)</span>
can naturally be reinterpreted from the perspective of electron-hole
coupling.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The phonon-mediated electron-electron (hole) coupling process doesn’t
sound “coherent” at all (e.g., inducing a positive charge cloud and
attracting another electron). Yet, this process is so holistic and
robust, even leading to so many strange phenomena and results.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
You’ve pointed out a very intriguing and important question: <strong>The
phonon-mediated electron-electron (or electron-hole) coupling process
seems “local” and even “random,” yet it macroscopically exhibits
extraordinary coherence and robustness, resulting in the peculiar
phenomena observed in superconductors.</strong> The answer lies in the
quantum mechanical collective effects and the nature of condensed matter
systems.
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does phonon-mediated electron-electron attraction seem
incoherent?</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<ul>
<li>Electron interactions via the lattice are fundamentally “local,”
limited by the speed of phonon propagation and electron motion.</li>
<li>Noise and randomness introduced by lattice vibrations. Phonon
frequencies and propagation characteristics are discrete, but phonons of
different frequencies can couple to electrons of varying momenta,
introducing “selectivity.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though phonon-mediated electron-electron coupling appears
susceptible to disturbances on a local scale, the entire superconducting
system displays remarkable robustness. This robustness arises from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantization of local interactions:</strong> The
phonon-mediated electron-electron coupling is a quantum process that can
extend across the entire system.</li>
<li><strong>Global quantum coherence:</strong> The paired states’
wavefunction forms a unified macroscopic quantum state, averaging out
local randomness and forming a stable condensate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interplay of these mechanisms ensures that, despite local
fluctuations, the system remains globally coherent and stable, allowing
the emergence of superconductivity.</p>

<p>Explain the phenomenon of subgap conductance enhancement in greater
detail.</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>Andreev reflection allows current to pass through the
metal-superconductor interface even when single-particle tunneling is
forbidden. This provides an additional transmission channel for current,
leading to enhanced conductance. In tunneling experiments, subgap
conductance is often several times higher than the conductance of normal
metal contacts.</p>
<p>In some cases, the interface can induce localized quantum states

Andreev reflection. <strong>Subgap conductance enhancement</strong> is a
result of Andreev reflection prominently boosting conductance for

<p><strong>Superconducting devices:</strong> Nonlinearity arises from
quantum mechanical effects (Andreev reflection and the superconducting
pairing potential).</p>
<p>While the physical mechanisms differ, these similarities can be
leveraged for device design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andreev reflection effects at the superconductor-normal metal
interface can mimic diode-like directional behavior by tuning the
tunneling barrier or interface properties.</li>
<li>In certain superconductor-graphene heterostructures, this diode-like
behavior is further amplified, allowing for the design of
superconducting electronic devices.</li>
<li>Nonlinear properties of superconducting devices are widely used in
high-sensitivity sensors (e.g., Josephson junctions or SQUIDs), which
outperform traditional diode sensors in sensitivity. Similar to diodes,
the nonlinearity of superconducting devices can be used to rectify and
modulate superconducting electronic flow.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Under what circumstances are Andreev Bound States induced?</p>
</blockquote>
<div style="width:80%; margin:0 auto;">
<p>Andreev Bound States are localized quantum states that form at the
superconductor-normal metal interface or in weak-link regions. The
wavefunction amplitude of these states decays with distance from the
interface, and the bound state energy depends on the scattering phase of
the interface. Their formation relies on the coherent reflection of
electrons and holes and the interference effect of multiple
reflections.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Finite interfaces:</strong> For example, in
superconductor-normal metal-superconductor (SNS) weak links, electrons
and holes reflect between interfaces. If the reflection phase satisfies
a standing wave condition, stable bound states form.</li>
<li><strong>Energy spectrum:</strong> These bound states fall within the
superconducting gap <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> and do
not enter the continuum spectrum.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection probability:</strong> Higher reflection
probability (e.g., low interface transmission) increases the likelihood
of bound state formation. Conversely, in strong coupling, bound states
may broaden or disappear.</li>
</ul>
<p>For standard <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-wave
superconductors, the energy spectrum of Andreev Bound States is
typically symmetric: <span class="math inline">\(E_{\text{ABS}} = \pm
\Delta \cdot f(\phi)\)</span>. In <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-wave superconductors or systems with
strong spin-orbit coupling, Andreev Bound States may evolve into
zero-energy states, exhibiting non-Abelian statistics (e.g., Majorana
modes).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Josephson junctions:</strong> In these, the energy of
Andreev Bound States directly depends on the phase difference between
two superconductors, changing periodically with the phase difference
<span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span>:</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  E_{\text{ABS}} = \pm \Delta \sqrt{1 - \tau \sin^2(\phi / 2)},
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is the transmission
coefficient. The existence of Andreev Bound States can be observed
through tunneling spectroscopy, where their energy corresponds to peaks
in tunneling conductance. In quantum dot-superconductor systems,
nonlinear conductance behavior can reflect the presence of Andreev Bound
States.</p>

<h4 id="supplementary">Supplementary</h4>
<h4 id="derivation-starting-from-the-hamiltonian"><strong>Derivation
Starting from the Hamiltonian</strong></h4>
<p>The behavior of electrons in superconductors can be described using
the <strong>BCS Hamiltonian</strong>: <span class="math display">\[
H = \sum_k (\epsilon_k - \mu) c^\dagger_k c_k + \sum_{k,k&#39;}
V_{k,k&#39;} c^\dagger_{k\uparrow} c^\dagger_{-k\downarrow}
c_{-k&#39;\downarrow} c_{k&#39;\uparrow},
\]</span></p>
<p>The BCS ground state is the condensate of Cooper pairs, described by
the wavefunction <span class="math inline">\(\Psi_{\text{BCS}}\)</span>.
Its key feature is macroscopic coherence: <span class="math display">\[
\Psi_{\text{BCS}} = \prod_k \left(u_k + v_k c^\dagger_{k\uparrow}
c^\dagger_{-k\downarrow}\right) |0\rangle.
\]</span></p>
<p>Considering the coupling between electrons and holes, a simplified
<strong>effective Hamiltonian</strong> can be introduced, which can be
diagonalized to calculate the eigenvalues of the quasiparticle energies:
<span class="math display">\[
H_{\text{eff}} = \begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_k - \mu &amp; \Delta \\
\Delta &amp; -(\epsilon_k - \mu)
\end{pmatrix}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Solving for the eigenvalues of this matrix, we obtain the
quasiparticle excitation energies in the superconducting condensate:
<span class="math display">\[
E_k = \sqrt{(\epsilon_k - \mu)^2 + \Delta^2}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Since quasiparticles are superpositions of electrons and holes, their
energy must account for both the kinetic energy and the pairing
potential. The quadratic summation reflects the independent
contributions of these two effects.</p>
<ul>
<li>For quasiparticles near the Fermi surface <span
class="math inline">\(|\epsilon_k - \mu| \approx 0\)</span>, the energy
approaches <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</li>
<li>For high-momentum states <span class="math inline">\(|\epsilon_k -
\mu| \gg \Delta|\)</span>, the energy approximates the free-particle
behavior of classical electrons or holes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The formation of quasiparticle states implies that the energies of
electrons and holes are effectively "mixed" into the same range, rather
than being separated into "above" or "below the gap."</p>
<h4 id="renormalization-in-superconducting-theory">Renormalization in
Superconducting Theory</h4>
<p>The initial system describes the behavior of free electrons: <span
class="math display">\[
H_0 = \sum_k \epsilon_k c_k^\dagger c_k.
\]</span></p>
<p>The coupling between electrons and phonons is described by the
interaction Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[
H_{\text{int}} = \sum_{k,k&#39;} g_{k,k&#39;} c_k^\dagger c_{k&#39;}
(a_q + a_q^\dagger).
\]</span></p>
<p>Electron-phonon interactions modify the self-energy <span
class="math inline">\(\Sigma(k, \omega)\)</span> of the electrons,
including all virtual processes mediated by phonons, thereby altering
the mass and energy of the electrons. Using Feynman diagram techniques,
the self-energy <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(k, \omega)\)</span>
encapsulates all phonon-mediated virtual processes: <span
class="math display">\[
G_{\text{eff}}(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k - \Sigma(k,
\omega)}.
\]</span> Here, <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma(k, \omega)\)</span>
represents the renormalized energy correction, directly determining the
effective mass and energy of the quasiparticles.</p>
<p>Electron-phonon interactions introduce an effective attractive
potential near the Fermi surface: <span
class="math inline">\(V_{\text{eff}} = -\lambda\)</span>. This
attractive potential causes electrons with momenta <span
class="math inline">\((k, -k)\)</span> to form Cooper pairs, ultimately
leading to the formation of a superconducting condensate on a global
scale. By diagonalizing the effective Hamiltonian, the wavefunctions and
energies of the quasiparticles can be obtained.</p>
<h4 id="current-phase-relation-the-josephson-effect">Current-Phase
Relation: The Josephson Effect</h4>
<p>Each Cooper pair in a superconductor shares a macroscopic
wavefunction: <span class="math display">\[
\Psi = |\Psi| e^{i\phi}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The phase difference <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\phi = \phi_1
- \phi_2\)</span> between two superconductors determines the magnitude
and direction of the current. The DC Josephson current <span
class="math inline">\(I_s\)</span> is related to the phase difference
by: <span class="math display">\[
I_s = I_c \sin(\Delta\phi),
\]</span></p>
<p>where the current’s dependence on <span
class="math inline">\(\sin(\Delta\phi)\)</span> is a typical quantum
interference phenomenon, directly relying on the stability of the
wavefunction phase. This interference indicates that the wavefunctions
of the two superconductors remain correlated, reflecting the global
coherence of the superconducting condensate. Even across a thin
connecting layer, the phases of the wavefunctions can remain linked. If
the relative phase difference <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta\phi\)</span> between the wavefunctions of
the two superconductors can be stably defined, the superconducting
current in the weak link can flow indefinitely without resistance.</p>
<p>In experiments, the current-phase relation can be measured by
adjusting the external current or magnetic field applied to the
Josephson junction. Typical experiments display periodic current
oscillations, fully determined by <span
class="math inline">\(\sin(\Delta\phi)\)</span>. When the Josephson
junction forms a closed loop (SQUID), the magnetic flux within the loop
is quantized: <span class="math display">\[
\Phi = n\Phi_0.
\]</span> This quantization of magnetic flux directly depends on the
phase consistency of the wavefunction. The quantum interference effect
of the phase leads to periodic variations in current under a magnetic
field, manifesting as a Fraunhofer pattern.</p>
