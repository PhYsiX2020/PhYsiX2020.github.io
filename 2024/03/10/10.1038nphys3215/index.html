<ul>
<li><p>such systems generically relax and equilibrate: despite the
unitary dynamics, following transient non-equilibrium dynamics,
expectation values of many observables equilibrate. This is specifically
true for local observables, which are supported only on a small number
of sites. The apparent long-time equilibrium state has to be equal to
the time average. This state is the maximum entropy state, holding all
constants of motion fixed. In the case of non-degenerate eigenvalues of
the Hamiltonian, this ensemble is also called the diagonal ensemble.</p>

relaxation time, and remain until a recurrence time that grows linearly
with system size. assume the otherwise arbitrary initial state has
suitably decaying correlations</p>
<p>non-commutative central limit theorems, Lieb-Robinson bounds (linear
scaling of recurrence time, excitations need to travel through the whole
system and reflected at the boundary)</p>
<p>no locality structure is available: one can still show equilibration
on average for all Hamiltonians that have non-degenerate energy gaps,
one can bound the time average by a quantity that is usually expected to
scale as one over the square root of the Hilbert space dimension of the
total system. This means that such out-of -equilibrium quantum systems
seem to be relaxed for most times, even if by that statement alone no
information on timescales can be deduced. describe the size of the time
fluctuation after relaxation</p>
<p>Ramps or sweeps, during which the Hamiltonian is changed according to
some schedule, are of interest in studies of dynamics of quantum phase
transitions. geometry, time-dependent periodic driving, pump-probe type
settings</p></li>
<li><p>Thermalization: equilibration towards a state that is close to
being indistinguishable from a thermal equilibrium state</p>
<p>thermodynamics in describing large-scale systems indicates that often
equilibrium values can be described by a few parameters, such as the
global temperature and particle number</p>
<p>mechanism: ETH, conjectures that sufficiently complex quantum systems
have eigenstates that are indistinguishable from thermal states with the
same average energy. ETH and its breakdown in integrable systems</p>
<p>thermalization in weakly interacting systems under stronger
conditions on the initial state. dynamical thermalization of local
expectation values to those in the global thermal state has been shown
under stronger conditions, most notably translation invariance and the
existence of unique Gibbs state. Effective thermalization under unitary
quantum dynamics can also be made plausible under conditions of
classical chaos. relative thermalization focuses on the decoupling of a
subsystem from a reference system</p>
<p>there is so far no compelling proof that globally quenched
non-integrable systems dynamically thermalize under local unitary
many-body dynamics</p>
<p>typicality arguments. rather than following the dynamical evolution
of a system, one tries to justify the applicability of ensembles by
showing that most states drawn randomly according to some measure have
the same properties as some appropriate ensemble</p>
<p>If a quantum system is integrable, in the sense that it has
sufficiently many local conserved quantities, one should not expect the
system to thermalize. these constants of motion prohibit full
thermalization to the canonical ensemble. equilibrate to the maximum
entropy state, generalized Gibbs ensemble. The explicit construction of
GGE for general interacting integrable models remains an open
problem</p>
<p>pre-thermalization, almost-integrable systems, continuous systems of
coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. Specially, in a close-to-free model,
there's an initial build-up of correlations where quasi-particles are
formed, where as actual thermalization occurs on much longer
timescales</p></li>
<li><p>‘Light cones’ and entanglement dynamics</p>
<p>understanding of the nonequilibrium dynamics of local Hamiltonian
models</p>
<p>That is to say, information propagation outside a `light cone' is
exponentially suppressed. It immediately follows that correlation
functions can grow significantly in time only inside the light cone.</p>
<p>Although these bounds are not necessarily tight, the picture that the
local dynamics leads to excitations travelling through the system with
velocity v offers much explanatory potential for nonequilibrium
dynamics</p>
<p>Many-body states are said to satisfy an area law for the entanglement
entropy, if for a subset of sites the latter scales only like the
boundary area of the subset rather than its volume. It has been shown
that if initially such a law holds, this will remain true for longer
times. Yet, at the same time, the prefactor of this area law is expected
to grow exponentially</p>
<p>However, all numerical tools share the feature that they are limited
to short times, which is in line with arguments using complexity theory,
which provide evidence that generic quantum long-time dynamics cannot be
efficiently classically simulated</p></li>
<li><p>Transport</p>
<p>simple paradigmatic models such as the Heisenberg spin chain or
Hubbard-type models. In these models, transport is expected to lead to
equilibration, as it allows the system to locally forget its precise
initial configuration</p>
<p>Two of the key aims are to distinguish between diffusive and
ballistic transport and to understand the limitations of linear response
theory</p></li>
<li><p>Absence of thermalization and many-body localization</p>
<p>defects, random potentials. non-interacting fermions in one dimension
or, equivalently, via Jordan Wigner transformation, for free spin
chains, Anderson's result gives strong localization of the fermionic
modes. These systems thus fail to serve as their own heat bath, and
transport is strongly suppressed</p>
<p>For interacting many-body systems, the effects of disorder are still
much less clear, despite great efforts of research in many-body
localization. Treating disorder as a perturbation, and starting from the
Fock space of Slater determinants, a key step in the understanding was
to develop an intuition of localization in Fock space</p>
<p>Interestingly, for out-of-equilibrium situations, both the support of
time-evolved local observables as well as the entanglement entropy are
numerically found to grow logarithmically in the interacting case, and
are thus unbounded</p>
<p>In several recent studies, localization eects due to disorder have
been associated with a lack of entanglement in many energy eigenstates,
or alternatively only in those below a so-called mobility edge</p>
<p>The localization of eigenstates leads to a clear violation of the ETH
and connects to an absence of thermalization eects for localizing
many-body systems and the existence of local constants of motion in
these models</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamics of quantum phase transitions</p>
<p>dynamical signatures of phase transitions. A key theoretical model
for these transitions, based on the adiabatic theorem, has been provided
by Kibble and Zurek for the important case of moving from a gapped phase
into criticality.</p>
<p>For strongly correlated systems in realistic experimental settings,
the dynamics of quantum phase transitions is more elusive and there are
indications that the complexity of the dynamics cannot fully be captured
by employing simple scaling arguments based only on the critical
exponents of the model</p></li>
<li><p>Quantum simulations</p>
<p>A particularly exciting perspective arises from the idea that
experimentally controlled quantum many-body systems constitute instances
of analogue quantum simulators95 overcoming these limitations. These
devices mimic natural interacting quantum many-body systems by
reconstructing their Hamiltonian, but now under precisely controlled
conditions.</p>
<p>Ultracold atoms in optical lattices. Following up on that, the
equilibration dynamics of such systems after quenches, the
light-cone-like spreading of correlations, and the expansion dynamics of
interacting bosons in homogeneous lattices in one and two dimensions
have been explored</p>
<p>Ultracold fermionic atoms. By making use of Feshbach resonances,
appropriate periodic driving, and superlattices generated by additional
optical lattices with half the wavelength, sophisticated quantum
simulations are conceivable for example, the simulation of lattice gauge
theories</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically driven systems</p>
<p>The eigenstates of such systems are usually constantly changing in
time, but the long-time dynamics can be inferred from their Floquet
operator</p>
<p>The effective Hamiltonian can be tuned by choosing an appropriate
driving schedule with great flexibility concerning the model parameters.
The synchronization of the motion of periodically driven systems with
the drive allows the description of the long-time behaviour by a
periodic ensemble</p></li>
<li><p>Perspectives for closed and open systems</p>
<p>The AdS/CFT-correspondence also contributes a novel tool to study
strongly correlated quantum systems out of equilibrium</p>
<p>Although it is understood under which conditions many-body systems
equilibrate, it is far from clear on what timescales they do so. The
main reason for this is that the role of locality for equilibration and
thermalization is, at least from a rigorous perspective, far from being
understood</p>
<p>A better understanding of the timescales of equilibration seems
crucial, as it is necessary to know whether the relevant physics is
captured by the long-time equilibrium state or happens in a possibly
markedly dierent non-equilibrium or quasi-stationary regime. The problem
of many-body localization has recently become a focus of attention, and
is developing rapidly, even if a unifying framework of the various
approaches still seems missing</p>
<p>a research area that deserves special attention is based on the idea
that noise and dissipation are not necessarily detrimental to attempts
to prepare and preserve interesting states of matter. In fact, such
preparations can be facilitated by suitably engineered local Markovian
noise, which can be rigorously captured in terms of the Liouvillian time
evolution of open quantum systems.</p></li>
